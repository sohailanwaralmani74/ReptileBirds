        <h3>What Is AI-Assisted Coding?</h3>
        <p>
            AI-assisted coding refers to the use of artificial intelligence tools to help developers write, debug, and optimize code. These tools, such as GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer, leverage machine learning models trained on vast amounts of code to provide real-time suggestions, auto-complete functions, and even generate entire code snippets based on natural language prompts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software engineers should consider using AI-assisted coding because it can significantly boost productivity, reduce repetitive tasks, and help catch errors early. However, it’s not a replacement for human expertise—engineers must still review AI-generated code for accuracy, security, and compliance with project requirements.

        <h3>Ways AI-Assisted Coding Can Benefit ITOps Engineers</h3>
       <p>
            ITOps engineers can benefit from AI-assisted coding in several ways. First, it can automate the creation of scripts for infrastructure management, such as provisioning servers or configuring networks. Second, AI tools can help troubleshoot issues by suggesting fixes for common errors in real-time. Third, these tools can assist in writing documentation by generating boilerplate text or comments, saving time for engineers who often juggle multiple tasks.

<div id="section3" class="section">
        <h3>Does AI-Assisted Coding Violate Open Source Licenses?</h3>
        <p>
            The use of AI-assisted coding tools has raised concerns about open source license violations. Since AI models are trained on publicly available code, including open source repositories, there’s a risk that the generated code might inadvertently reproduce licensed material. For example, GitHub Copilot has faced scrutiny for potentially generating code that matches existing open source projects, which could violate licenses like the GPL if not properly attributed. Developers should be cautious and review AI-generated code to ensure compliance with licensing requirements.
        </p>

<div id="section4" class="section">
        <h3>GitHub Copilot vs. Amazon CodeWhisperer</h3>
        <p>
            GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer are two leading AI-assisted coding tools, but they have distinct differences. Copilot, developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI, integrates seamlessly with IDEs like Visual Studio Code and offers broad language support. It excels at generating code from natural language prompts and has a large user base. On the other hand, Amazon CodeWhisperer, developed by AWS, focuses on enterprise use cases, offering features like security scanning and integration with AWS services. While Copilot is more general-purpose, CodeWhisperer may appeal more to developers working within the AWS ecosystem.
