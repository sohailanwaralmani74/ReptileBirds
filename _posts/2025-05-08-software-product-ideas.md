The world has become a global village. We can now find solutions and desired products/ materials at our doorstep with our fingertips. (Trust issues still exist in third-world countries.) We already have too many Software products to solve and overcome our daily issues. However, we still have too many uncovered or less covered areas that need to be considered for our next powerful software product ideas.
